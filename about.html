        <b>ABOUT ME</b>
        <br><br>
        <div>
          Dear all,
          <br>
          </br> 
          <br>
          </br> 
        I’ve tried my hand at a lot of things and somehow ended up in the world of tech, energy efficiency, and AI. It’s been quite the ride, and I’ve enjoyed pushing myself in different directions.
        <br>
          </br> 
        </div>

        <ul>
          <b>Education:</b>
          <li> - Bachelor's in International Relations (because the world is complex and fascinating)</li>
          <li> - Master’s in Business Analytics (with a shiny 5.5/6 final paper)</li>
          <li> - Exchange at the American University of Beirut (where I learned a lot more than just academics)</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <ul>
          <b>What I’ve worked on:</b>
          <li> - Backend Developer at a Geneva Fintech (refactoring an ERP system for fun and profit)</li>
          <li> - Business Intelligence Intern at Amazon (where I built a Random Forest model and learned a ton about data)</li>
          <li> - Assistant Professor in Consumer Behavior & Brain Lab (a fascinating dive into how we think and act)</li>
          <li> - Co-founder of INEEA (an energy efficiency consultancy that’s still growing)</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <ul>
          <b>Side Hustles:</b>
          <li> - Board Visualizer Project (scraping data and clustering companies in Geneva)</li>
          <li> - SaaS platform for energy efficiency (because sustainability is the future)</li>
          <li> - The Elona Project: ML to predict home energy consumption (it’s all about smarter living)</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <ul>
          <b>Languages & Tech:</b>
          <li> - Python (Django framework)</li>
          <li> - JavaScript (React, because front-ends matter too)</li>
          <li> - SQL/PostgreSQL (data is life)</li>
          <li> - PyTorch (because deep learning is just cool)</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <ul>
          <b>Places I've Called Home:</b>
          <li> - France: 20 years</li>
          <li> - Australia: 1 year</li>
          <li> - Lebanon: 1 year and 8 months</li>
          <li> - Switzerland: 8 years (where I’m finally settling, sort of)</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <ul>
          <b>Where I’ve Wandered:</b>
          <li> - Morocco</li>
          <li> - Namibia</li>
          <li> - South Africa</li>
          <li> - Thailand</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <ul>
          <b>Languages I Speak:</b>
          <li> - French (native)</li>
          <li> - English (fluent)</li>
          <li> - Arabic (let's say 'work in progress')</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p>
          I’m about AI, just the healthy amount of Humanities, and building products that have a direct impact. I thrive when I’m pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, especially when it comes to tech.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
          My life’s a mix of coding, beach volley, swimming, running and sharing moments with the people I respect and appreciate. I’m also pretty big on building stuff that’s both beautiful and functional—without the unnecessary fluff. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
          Fun fact: I co-founded an energy efficiency consulting firm with my boyfriend, and we’re working on a custom ERP system to help manage projects more smoothly. On the side, I’m diving deeper into reinforcement learning and deep learning?
        </p>

        <p>Enough about me, now tell me about you!</p>

        <br>
        </br> 
          Yours truly,
          <br>
